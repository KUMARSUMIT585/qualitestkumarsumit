    Web App Sample Test + Specflow
    Extent Reports

# Dependencies

    same is the case with IE browser (Version 11.1217)

# Extensions To Be Installed in VS Code

# Debt so far 
    tests not complete- started too late in the day & was occupied at office work (could not code all that was planned).
    Could do justice if I bargain time again
   Most things missing because I could spend very little time .
   
    further improvements-
    1.more configurations
    2.seperation between business functions and tests
    3.page classes (could not build due to time)
    4.more reusability
    5.more utility functions 
    6.multi threaded for fast executions
